Hlw, I am Rezwan. I've completed my graduation from Aiub. Currently i'm working as a software 
engineer at Piistech. There we are using asp.net MVC technology for building a CRM and ERP system for
many American clients. I'm very pasionate about my work. I have always loved to explore new It related
technologeis and building new things. So I suppose it's natural I became a software engineer. I have 
worked in a variety of role in my current company and now i'm up for a new challange.The most importent
thing is that I continue to learn in my career.I'm kind of person who needs new tasks to stay
focused. Hopefully Stack Learner take my knoladge to a new lavel and i will be benifited for my upcoming 
career.
